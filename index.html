   <p>If you read the previous tab, you'll know a bit more about this. Constable School has many different clubs. Some of them perform in concerts, such as members of Choir, Chamber Choir, Wind Symphony, (Advanced) Orchestra, Concert Band, and Jazz Band. Of course, there are other clubs. Student Congress helps plan Spirit Days, Safety Patrol helps people be safe, Yearbook Members help edit the yearbook, Morning Announcers help do the announcements, and there is a group for Plays! You can't be all of these, but as I know, you can be part of quite a lot of these clubs! And, they are back and ready for more, after the pandemic of COVID-19.</p>
